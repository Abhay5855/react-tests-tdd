# Simple React App with Tests (Beta, WIP)

> This is a work in progress repo, not ready for prime time yet - Ankush

Create a simple react app that has tests working

Clone this repo and ensure that you are following [Git Flow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) convention to 
submitting PRs to your OWN repo

## To Do
- [ ] Setup testing framework
- [ ] Add tests
- [ ] Setup GitHub actions

## Requirements:

Ensure that you follow TDD approach to writing your code.
The tests are available and marked as `skip`. Enable your tests by converting the
`skip` into `test`

Ensure that your milestone tests are passing, before submitting the PR

### Milestone `Tall`

- [ ] Create a controlled component input box
- [ ] Create a composed sign up component using the input box components
- [ ] Perform validations on the input to enable/disable the Next step button

### Milestone `Grande`

- [ ] Create an OTP component
- [ ] Upon successful email/name entry, get to OTP step

## Milestone vocabulary

Starbucks has the following denotions for sizes:

```
Tall - Small glass
Grande - Regular glass
Venti - Big mug
Trenta - Biggest bucket
```

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
